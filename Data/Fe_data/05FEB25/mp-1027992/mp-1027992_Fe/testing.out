/home/sethshj/.conda/envs/Corvus2/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pymatgen/io/cif.py:1276: UserWarning: The default value of primitive was changed from True to False in https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/pull/3419. CifParser now returns the cell in the CIF file as is. If you want the primitive cell, please set primitive=True explicitly.
